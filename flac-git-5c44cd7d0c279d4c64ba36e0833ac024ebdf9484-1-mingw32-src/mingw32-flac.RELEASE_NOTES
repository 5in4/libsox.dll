mingw flac
========================================================================
FLAC stands for Free Lossless Audio Codec, an audio format similar to MP3,
but lossless, meaning that audio is compressed in FLAC without any loss
in quality. This is similar to how Zip works, except with FLAC you will get
much better compression because it is designed specifically for audio, and
you can play back compressed FLAC files in your favorite player (or your
car or home stereo, see supported devices) just like you would an MP3 file.

FLAC stands out as the fastest and most widely supported lossless audio
codec, and the only one that at once is non-proprietary, is unencumbered
by patents, has an open-source reference implementation, has a well
documented format and API, and has several other independent
implementations.
